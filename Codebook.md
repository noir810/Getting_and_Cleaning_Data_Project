###Steps to create tidydata.csv###
- Download and unzip the file
- read.table() was used to read the data and then they were assigned to a suited variable. 
- Merge, using rbind() and cbind(), the "train" and "test" files to create one data set.
- Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
- Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
